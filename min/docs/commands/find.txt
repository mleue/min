find a file

EXAMPLES
	find . -name '*.txt'
		print all filepaths to .txt files anywhere under .
	find . -iname 'somefile'
		print all filepaths to files containing 'somefile' anywhere under ., case-insensitive

FLAGS
	-name		the pattern of the filename to search for (excluding the path)
				important to put the pattern into '', so that it doesn't get globbed by bash
	-iname		case-insensitive search pattern
	-maxdepth	maximum depth at which to search through subdirectories
	-type		the type of file to search for (f - file, d - directory, l - symbolic link)
