branch operations

EXAMPLES
	git branch
		show all locally available branches, mark the currently active branch
	git branch -a
		show all available branches (local and remote)
	git branch -r
		show available branches on the remote
	git branch -d branch1
		delete branch1 (will throw an error if branch1 isn't merged into something else yet and commits would become unreachable)
	git branch -u origin branchName
		set branchName on the origin remote to be the upstream branch of the currently active one

FLAGS
	-a			list all branches (local and remote)
	-r			list only remote branches
	-u			set upstream information for the currently active branch
	--merged	list only branches that are already merged (i.e. safe to delete)
	--no-merged	list only branches that are not yet merged
