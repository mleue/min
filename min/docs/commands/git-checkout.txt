switch where HEAD is pointing to

EXAMPLES
	git checkout branch1
		switch HEAD to point to branch1
	git checkout -b branch1
		create a new branch branch1 and switch HEAD to point to it
		(if a branch of that name exists on the remote, git will automatically set the remote branch1 as the upstream of the local branch1)
	git checkout -b branch1 commit-hash
		create a new branch branch1 pointing to commit-hash and switch HEAD to point to it

FLAGS
	-b	create a new branch

RELATED
