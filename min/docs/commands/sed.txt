used mostly to apply an ex-style regexp substitution to a file
(very much like applying ex commands in vim, just right from bash)

EXAMPLES
	sed s/foo/bar/g file.txt
		replace foo with bar globally in file.txt
	sed /^foo/d file.txt
		delete all lines in file.txt that start on foo

FLAGS
	-i	change file in place
